API keys:

# How to set up an asymmetric API key?

### 1. Create the public and private key pair

- Can be created using OpenSSL or by Python script below


### 2. Creating new API key on Deribit

- Can by created using Front-end interface or Deribit API


### 3. Authenticate with an Asymetric API key

- You can authenticate via Deribit Signature Credentials using Shell or Python examples, provided at the end of the article



## 1. Creating the public and private key pair

To create a public and private key pair you can either use Python script provided further below or use OpenSSL. OpenSSL is an open-source software library that provides tools and libraries for secure communication, implementing the SSL and TLS protocols for encryption, cryptographic functions, and digital certificates.

## OpenSSL

##### Step 1: Make sure that OpenSSL is installed on your OS

##### Windows

**Check if OpenSSL is Installed:**

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Type the following command and press Enter: openssl version
3. If OpenSSL is installed, you will see the version number. If not, proceed to install it.

**Install OpenSSL:**

1. Download the installer from **[this link](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)**.
2. Choose the version appropriate for your system (Win32 or Win64).
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions.

##### macOS

**Check if OpenSSL is Installed:**

1. Open Terminal.
2. Type the following command and press Enter: openssl version
3. If OpenSSL is installed, you will see the version number. If not, proceed to install it.

**Install OpenSSL:**

1. Use Homebrew to install OpenSSL. If you don’t have Homebrew installed, please refer to **[their official website.](https://brew.sh/)**
2. Once Homebrew is installed, run: brew install openssl
3. You may need to add OpenSSL to your PATH. Follow the instructions given by Homebrew after installation to do this.

##### Linux

**Check if OpenSSL is Installed:**

1. Open Terminal.
2. Type the following command and press Enter: openssl version
3. If OpenSSL is installed, you will see the version number. If not, proceed to install it.

**Install OpenSSL:**

The installation commands may vary depending on your Linux distribution. Here are the commands for a few common distributions:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

sudo apt update sudo apt install openssl

**Fedora:**

sudo dnf install openssl

**Arch Linux:**

sudo pacman -S openssl
